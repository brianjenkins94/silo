/**
 * The guard primitive: check a value against a runtime predicate at a boundary, and react via a
 * PLUGGABLE handler. One primitive, one policy knob — the same instrumentation whether you throw
 * (assert), record (observe), or hand off to the broker:
 *
 *   - `record` (default) — tally the violation and KEEP GOING. Non-crashing; accumulates the
 *     "verified" evidence for silo's quality-trust score.
 *   - `strict` — throw. Dev / CI. `typia.assert`-style.
 *   - (a broker-prompt handler can gate on it, same as the capability broker.)
 *
 * The predicate is hand-written today; the design is for it to be GENERATED from the declared TS
 * type (typia et al.) and INJECTED at boundaries by a transform — this module is the runtime target
 * that transform emits calls to. Lives in silo (with enforce/box.ts) until a second repo
 * outside silo actually consumes it, at which point it earns a hoist to lib. See review-helper design.
 *
 * The sink is module-global for now (fine for a single run); a real deployment may want a per-context
 * sink so concurrent runs don't co-mingle.
